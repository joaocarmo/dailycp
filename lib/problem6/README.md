# Problem # 6

###### [Easy]

When climbing a set of stairs, you can choose to climb either 1 or 2 steps at a
time. Given an `N` number of steps, find all the possible combinations of
climbing the stairs.

**Examples:**

Given `N = 3`, the answer should be `3` because you can climb the stairs using
one of three possibilities: `[1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 1]` or `[1, 2]`.

Given `N = 4`, the answer should be `5` because you can climb the stairs using
one of five possibilities: `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, `[2, 1, 1]`, `[1, 2, 1]`,
`[1, 1, 2]` or `[2, 2]`.

**Assume that:**

We're only dealing with positive integers.
