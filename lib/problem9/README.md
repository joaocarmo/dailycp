# Problem # 9

###### [Easy]

In a given list of numbers `A`, every number appears twice expect for one. Find
the single number.

```ts
function solution(A: number[]): number {}
```

**Examples:**

Given `A = [2, 2, 5, 5, 1]`, the answer should be `1`.

**Assume that:**

We're only dealing with positive integers and there is always a solution.
